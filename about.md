The Fermilab Coding Club was formed with the intention of sharing knowledge a tools between the many talents, backgrounds, and varied expertise we have at the lab.

We meet once a week on Tuesdays.

It is essential for Coding Club to be collaborative. We learn best from watching others. Being able to ask questions in the moment and see how others respond to a live coding challenge can really inspire confidence.

Each week, someone shares an introduction into something they are interested in or a detailed explainer of something they are expert in.

Starting in 2019 we are trying longer form format where we take a deep dive into a project and each week we work together to complete a small piece of the larger project.
